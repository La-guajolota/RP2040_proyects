# üì° Digital Modulation Techniques on RP2040

![RP2040](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCU-RP2040-blueviolet) ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C-blue)

This project is a hands-on demonstration of several fundamental digital modulation techniques, implemented on the Raspberry Pi Pico. It takes an analog signal as input and generates corresponding modulated outputs.

## üìù Description

This program continuously samples an analog signal using the ADC and uses this value to generate the following modulations in real-time:

- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):** The duty cycle of a square wave is varied in proportion to the analog input signal's amplitude.
- **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM):** The analog signal is quantized into discrete levels (in this case, 8-bit) and transmitted as a serial stream of digital codes.
- **Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM):** The project generates a fixed-frequency, fixed-width pulse train that can serve as a carrier for PAM. *Note: True PAM would require an external circuit to vary the amplitude of these pulses based on the analog signal.*
- **Pulse Position Modulation (PPM):** The code includes a placeholder comment for PPM. *Note: A full PPM implementation, where the position of a pulse is shifted, would typically require using the Pico's Programmable I/O (PIO) and is not included in this C file.*

## üöÄ How to Build and Run

1.  **Build and Flash:**
    - Compile the C code in the `telecomms/digital_modulators` directory and flash the `.uf2` file to your Pico.

2.  **Connect your hardware:**
    - Connect your analog signal source to GPIO 26.
    - Connect an oscilloscope probe to GPIO 22 to observe the PWM signal.
    - Connect another oscilloscope probe to GPIO 29 to observe the PAM carrier.
    - Connect the Pico to your computer via USB.

## üëÄ Observing the Modulations

- **PWM:**
    - On your oscilloscope, you will see a square wave on GPIO 22. As you vary the input voltage on GPIO 26, the width (duty cycle) of the pulses will change.

- **PAM Carrier:**
    - On GPIO 29, you will see a constant, high-frequency square wave with a fixed duty cycle. This serves as the pulse train for a PAM system.

- **PCM:**
    - The Pico will appear as a serial device on your computer.
    - Use a serial terminal or a custom script to read the raw byte stream. Each byte represents a single 8-bit sample of the analog input.
    - You can then plot this data to reconstruct the quantized analog waveform.
