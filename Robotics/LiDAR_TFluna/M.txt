MG995 PWM Input Signal
The MG995 360-degree continuous rotation servo motor operates using a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) input signal. The PWM signal controls the direction and speed of the motor. When the PWM signal is high for 0.5ms, the motor starts rotating in one direction, and when it is high for 1.5ms, it stops. A signal high for 2.5ms causes the motor to rotate in the opposite direction. The MG995 can rotate continuously in either direction based on the duty cycle of the PWM signal, unlike typical servos that can only rotate within a 180-degree range.

To control the MG995 servo motor, you can use the built-in Servo.h library in Arduino. The PWM signal should be connected to a PWM-capable pin on the Arduino, such as pin 9, and the power and ground pins should be connected to a separate power supply to avoid erratic behavior.

The motor responds to PWM signals at a frequency of 50 Hz, meaning each cycle of the PWM signal is 20 milliseconds long. The position or direction of the motor depends on the duty cycle of the signal.

MG995 Servo Motor: A high torque standard size servo motor that can rotate continuously in either direction. It operates on a 5V nominal power supply and has a current draw of about 10mA at idle and up to 1.3 to 1.5A under stall conditions.
Arduino PWM Pin: A PWM-capable pin on the Arduino, such as pin 9, is used to connect the PWM signal input of the MG995 servo motor.
Servo.h Library: This library is used to control the MG995 servo motor by setting the PWM signal values without manually calculating the duty cycle.
PWM Signal: The PWM signal controls the rotation direction and speed of the MG995 servo motor. The signal high times of 0.5ms, 1.5ms, and 2.5ms correspond to rotating in one direction, stopping, and rotating in the opposite direction, respectively.
Power Supply: It is recommended to power the MG995 servo motor with a separate power supply to avoid erratic behavior when powered directly from an Arduino board.
Continuous Rotation: Unlike standard servos, the MG995 can rotate continuously in either direction, making it suitable for applications requiring constant rotation
