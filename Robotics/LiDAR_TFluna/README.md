This project transforms a simple, single-point LiDAR sensor into a full 2D scanning LiDAR system using a servo motor and a Raspberry Pi Pico. It includes a real-time graphical interface to visualize the scanned environment.

## üìù Description

This project combines three main components:

1.  **TF-Luna LiDAR Sensor:** A compact, low-cost LiDAR sensor that provides distance measurements. It is read via I2C.
2.  **SG90 Servo Motor:** A standard hobby servo that sweeps the LiDAR sensor back and forth from 0 to 180 degrees.
3.  **Raspberry Pi Pico:** The brain of the operation. The Pico orchestrates the hardware, reads the sensor data, controls the servo, and sends the data to a host computer.

The system uses an interrupt connected to the TF-Luna's "data ready" pin. This allows the Pico to efficiently capture a new distance reading as soon as it's available. The Pico then prints the current servo angle and the measured distance to the serial console in a `angle:distance` format.

## üñ•Ô∏è Real-Time Radar UI

A Python script (`ui/radar.py`) provides a live, graphical representation of the LiDAR data. It reads the serial data from the Pico and plots the points on a polar grid, creating a radar-like display of the surrounding environment.

## üöÄ How to Build and Run

1.  **Build and Flash:**
    - Compile the C code in the `Robotics/LiDAR_TFluna` directory and flash the `.uf2` file to your Pico.

2.  **Run the Python UI:**
    - Connect the Pico to your computer via USB.
    - Navigate to the `ui` directory.
    - Modify the `serial_port` variable in `radar.py` to match your Pico's serial port.
    - Run the script:
      ```bash
      python radar.py
      ```

3.  **Observe:**
    - The servo will start to scan, and the Python UI will display the LiDAR data in real-time!
